## **About the Submission**  

### **Introduction**   

Welcome to "For the 50". It is estimated that there are 50 million men, women, and children trapped in modern slavery around the world today. That equates to 1 in 150 people. Awareness is increasing on the subject but more still needs to be done to help the afflicted, and our goal is to showcase the issues surrounding modern slavery, and provide a voice for the 50 million people. 

How can we help? Raising awareness is a positive start but there is so much more. Giving people the necessary tools to identify instances of modern slavery, providing resources and relevant contact details are a minimum that is required. Our mission is to provide a platform for people to stand up against this vile and abhorrent act.

## UX - User Experience

#### Colour

![colour pallette](docs/documentation/colour_pallette.png)

The color palette was created through comparisons of similar websites of this nature. The focus of the website is to highlight the atrocities of Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking and the colour pallete was used to create a clean and crisp structure that allows the user to easily digest available information without providing distraction.

### Font

![font](docs/documentation/font.png)

We opted to use a merriweather font for the site. This font is considered to be accessible in regards that it is easy to read on all screens and particularly useful when a site is displaying a high level of information. Merriweatherâ€™s reliable style is great for a site that wants to emphasize trust. Where a credibile look is desired the merriweather font is essential.
