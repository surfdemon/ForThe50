            Modern slavery and human trafficking are grave violations of human rights that affect millions globally,
            including in the UK and Ireland. Understanding these issues is the first step to combating them.
            <strong>Pull the 50</strong> is a project to help bring awareness to the estimated fifty million people in
            slavery today.

            Modern slavery involves individuals being exploited and unable to refuse or leave due to threats, coercion, or deception. This exploitation can take many forms, including forced labor, debt bondage, domestic servitude, sexual exploitation, and even criminal activities. Victims are often stripped of their freedom, denied basic rights, and subjected to degrading and inhumane treatment. According to recent estimates, over 50 million people globally are trapped in modern slavery, with women and children disproportionately affected. Industries such as agriculture, construction, hospitality, and beauty services are among the sectors where exploitation is most prevalent. These crimes operate in the shadows, often concealed from public view, making detection and intervention challenging but crucial.

            In 2024, the UK recorded 4,758 referrals for potential victims of modern slavery in just the third quarter, a 15% increase compared to the same period in 2023. This stark rise highlights the growing need for vigilance and intervention. Among the victims identified, 68% were adults, and 31% were children, with many subjected to labor, sexual, and criminal exploitation. Ireland, too, has seen a troubling increase in cases, with 53 victims identified in 2023, marking a 20% rise from 2021. These figures are likely underreported, as many victims remain hidden due to fear, stigma, or a lack of awareness of their rights. Tackling this issue requires a collective effort, involving governments, NGOs, law enforcement agencies, and communities, to ensure that victims are supported and traffickers are held accountable.</p>

              Modern slavery involves individuals being exploited and unable to refuse or leave due to threats, coercion,

              revolves around the recruitment, transportation, and exploitation of victims through fraud, force, or
              coercion.
