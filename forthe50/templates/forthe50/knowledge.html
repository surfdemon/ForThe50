        </div>
        <p>
          Modern slavery is a grave violation of human rights, where individuals are forced into exploitative conditions through threats, coercion, or deception. It is a hidden crime that affects millions of people worldwide, depriving them of their freedom and dignity.
        </p>
        <p>It manifests in various forms, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Forced labor:</strong> Victims are compelled to work under threats or coercion, often in unsafe and exploitative conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Debt bondage:</strong> Individuals are trapped into working to pay off debts, often under unfair and escalating conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Domestic servitude:</strong> People are forced to work in private households without pay, often subjected to abuse and isolation.</li>
          <li><strong>Sexual exploitation:</strong> Victims are coerced into prostitution or other forms of sexual abuse for the financial benefit of traffickers.</li>
          <li><strong>Criminal exploitation:</strong> Individuals are forced into unlawful activities such as drug trafficking or theft, often under duress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Human trafficking, closely linked to modern slavery, involves the recruitment, transportation, and exploitation of individuals through fraud, force, or coercion. Traffickers often prey on vulnerabilities such as poverty, lack of education, or unstable living situations to exploit victims.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together, modern slavery and human trafficking represent a global crisis that requires awareness, intervention, and action to eradicate.

          <h2 class="fw-bold">Recognizing the Signs of Modern Slavery</h2>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Recognizing these signs can vary depending on the context or industry. Be vigilant for: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Workers appearing controlled or accompanied by someone who speaks on their behalf.</li>
          <li>Restricted movement, communication, or access to their surroundings.</li>
          <li>Signs of physical exhaustion or fear of punishment for speaking out.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Modern slavery often goes unnoticed, hidden in plain sight within communities and workplaces. By learning to recognize the signs, we can take crucial steps to rescue victims and end exploitation. Key indicators include:
