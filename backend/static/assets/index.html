                        Modern slavery involves individuals being exploited and unable to refuse or leave due to threats, coercion, or deception. This exploitation can take many forms, including forced labor, debt bondage, domestic servitude, sexual exploitation, and even criminal activities. Meanwhile, human trafficking is a crime that revolves around the recruitment, transportation, and exploitation of victims through fraud, force, or coercion.

                          In 2024, the UK recorded 4,758 referrals for potential victims of modern slavery in just the third quarter, a 15% increase compared to the same period in 2023.
68% of victims were adults, and 31% were children.


The most common forms of exploitation include labor, sexual, and criminal.
In Ireland, 53 victims were identified in 2023, marking a 20% increase from 2021.
The urgency to address these crimes is evident, as they rob individuals of their freedom and dignity.
